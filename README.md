SCENARIO-
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

APPROACH-
I haved used python for  merging the datasets of the last 12 monthes and to clean the data.
Then I dropped the unnecessary columns to make our analysis easier.
Then I used the tableau for the visualisation purpose.
