SCENARIO-
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

APPROACH-
I haved used python for  merging the datasets of the last 12 monthes and to clean the data.
Then I dropped the unnecessary columns to make our analysis easier.
Then I used the tableau for the visualisation purpose.

From this line graph it is clear that the ride duration of the casual users is far more than the member users. There is a drastical change(more ride duration) in the ride duration in the summer season for the casual users. For the member users it also increases in the summer but not like as for the casual riders.

This graph shows the months in which the casual riders ride for more time. The monthes include July,June,August and september( The summer season)

This shows that the casual riders do not want to use the bikes during the winter season.The number of rides also increases in the summer season. From the first graph and this one we conclude that the averagre ride duration for a casual rider per month is more than that of a member rider.

This is the graph of the busiest stations for the casual riders.

The users use the bikes more during the afternoon and the evening.

Both the ride numbers and the ride durations drastically increases during the weekends for the casual riders.
The ride duration gets doubled during the weekends compared to the weekdays for the casual riders whereas for the member riders both the number of rides and ride duration remains nearly the same throughout the week.

SUMMARY-
Casual riders take long rides than the members.
Casual riders are most active on weekends.
Casual riders ride for more duration during the summer season.
The casual riders ride for more duration during the afternoon and evening time.
From the above two points it concludes that the casual riders use the bikes for recreational purpose.
During the winter season the people prefer public transport and own cars for the cold weather( As the rides decrease during the winter season)
The busiest stations for the casual riders are Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Wells St & Concord Ln,Michigan Ave & Oak St,Millenium Park etc.


RECOMMENDATION-
The company should initiate riding pakages keeping recreational activities, weekend activities and summer events in mind and should give special discounts to the casual users during these time to encourage them to buy annual membership.
The company should consider of giving seasonal pass to the casual riders.
The company should target the casual riders on the busiest days(weekends) and busiest months(July,June,August) and busiest time in a day( in the afternoon and the evening time) for their promotions.
